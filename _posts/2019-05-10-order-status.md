We’re excited to announce the addition of order status tracking to CoffeePass! Up to this point, we’ve sent a notification to users when a barista starts working on their order, but didn’t have any other feedback to give more insight into when the order would be ready for pickup. That worked alright, but we know we can do better, and order status will allow us to do just that! Additionally, tracking order status will allow us to gather data on shop and item specific prep times to make predictions even better in the future! Here’s how it’ll work:

1. After a customer places an order, they’ll see an order status screen, which will initially display “Received” and give a wait time.  

2. When a barista acknowledges their order on the order-processing app, the status will change to “In Progress” and the wait time will begin to count down

3. When the barista fulfills the order on the order-processing tablet, the order status will change to “Ready” and a button will appear for the customer to acknowledge that the picked up their order.

4. After the customer clicks the “I Picked Up My Order!” button, they’ll be given the chance to rate the quality of their pickup experience and the items themselves with just a click! They’ll also have the option to give more thorough, written feedback if they choose.


This feature will drastically improve the customer experience, both directly, through the real-time updates, and indirectly, through the data that we can gather, which will lead to more precise wait-time predictions. The frictionless review process will ensure that we’re working as well as possible with each individual coffee shop.
